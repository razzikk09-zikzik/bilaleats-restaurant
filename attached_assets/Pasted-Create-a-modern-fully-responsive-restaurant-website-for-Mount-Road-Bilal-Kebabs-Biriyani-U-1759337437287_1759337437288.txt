Create a modern, fully responsive restaurant website for "Mount Road Bilal â€“ Kebabs & Biriyani".

Make it clean, minimal, but interactive with smooth animations and transitions. 

The website should include the following pages and features:

   - Animated text and button (e.g., "Order Now", "View Menu").
   - Scrolling animation effects for sections.

   - Short history of the restaurant.
   - Highlight that it has multiple branches.
   - Use timeline or animated cards to show milestones.

3. **Menu Page**
   - Interactive food list with categories (Biriyani, Kebabs, Starters, Drinks, Desserts).
   - Each item should have name, image, price, and short description.
   - Hover effects (zoom-in or highlight).

4. **Branches Page**
   - Display list of multiple branches with Google Maps embed for each location.
   - Include branch address, phone number, and timings.
   - Use cards with animation on hover.

   - Phone number and email clickable links.

6. **Navbar & Footer**

   - Use modern fonts like "Poppins" or "Montserrat".
   - Add hover animations on buttons and images.
   - Make everything mobile-friendly.

Tech Requirements:
- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (backend should be such a wayfor only required stuff such as details collected meas it should go to mail of the restaurant like that ).
